When the code runs, the user is asked to select a difficulty level between easy, medium and hard.

The difficulty level influences the quiz in three different ways:
1 the questions are going to be harder. High difficulty means that lesser known movies are included in the possible questions.
2 as the chosen difficulty gets higher, the user will receive less information about the question asked.
3 the points deducted when a question is not answered correctly are more in harder difficulties. 
The code also handles wrong inputs from the user.

After the difficulty is chosen, the quiz starts.  Ten questions will be asked. 
Questions are random, there is only one right answer and there are no duplicates in the possible answers.
Each time the user does not respond correctly, the right answer will be revealed before being asked the next question.
Also, the code will handle wrong inputs from the user. 

At the end of the quiz, a line chart along with the final score will be displayed.
After that, the user will be able to retake the quiz.

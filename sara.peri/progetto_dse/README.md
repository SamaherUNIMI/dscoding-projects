# Weather Dataset Project

This project explores three datasets containing monthly mean temperature records since 1750, categorized by country, city, and state.

## Web Application Overview

The 'Weather App' comprises three main sections:

### 1. Statistics

This section presents descriptive statistics and various informative graphs for each dataset.

### 2. Maps

Here, diverse types of maps display temperature variations in different formats for datasets related to countries and major cities.

### 3. Datasets

This section details the datasets used and operations performed on them to enhance interpretation.

## Project Structure

The project directory consists of the following folders:

- `data`: Contains datasets and information about the datasets.
- `code`: Holds all the project's code.

### Code Structure

- `app_weather.py`: Main script for the web application.
- `datasets.py`, `dati.py`, `mappe.py`, `statistiche.py`: Python files housing classes used in `app_weather.py`.
